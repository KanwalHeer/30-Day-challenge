Day 20
### Question 1: Check for Prime Number
*Problem:*  
Write a TypeScript function that takes a positive integer as input and checks whether it is a prime number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. If the number is prime, return true; otherwise, return false.

*Hint:*  
- Use a loop to check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.
- If the number is divisible by any of these, it is not prime.

typescript
function isPrime(num: number): boolean {
    // Your code here
}


### Question 2: Reverse a Number
*Problem:*  
Write a TypeScript function that takes a number as input and returns the number with its digits reversed. For example, if the input is 1234, the output should be 4321.

*Hint:*  
- Convert the number to a string, reverse the string, and then convert it back to a number.

typescript
function reverseNumber(num: number): number {
    // Your code here
}
