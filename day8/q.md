### Day 8: TypeScript Modules (Export and Import)

#### Question 1: Exporting and Importing Multiple Functions

*Question:*
Create two separate files. In the first file, define and export two functions: calculateArea (calculates the area of a rectangle given its width and height) and calculatePerimeter (calculates the perimeter of a rectangle given its width and height). In the second file, import both functions and use them to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle with a width of 5 and a height of 10. Print the results to the console.

*Hint:*
- Use export to export the functions in the first file.
- Use named imports to bring the functions into the second file.
- Ensure that the file paths are correctly specified when importing.

#### Question 2: Exporting and Importing Interfaces and Classes

*Question:*
Create three separate files. In the first file, define and export an interface Shape with properties name and area, and a method calculateArea(). In the second file, define and export a class Circle that implements the Shape interface. The class should have a property radius and implement the calculateArea method. In the third file, import the Circle class, create an instance of Circle, and print the name and area of the circle.

*Hint:*
- Use export to export the interface in the first file.
- Use export to export the class in the second file.
- Use named imports to bring the interface and class into the third file.
- Ensure that the file paths are correctly specified when importing.
