*Function Signature:*
typescript
function findMissingNumber(arr: number[]): number {
    // Your code here
}


*Hints:*

1. *Sum Formula:*
   - Use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: \(\text{Sum} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). This gives you the total sum if no numbers were missing.

2. *Sum the Array:*
   - Calculate the sum of all elements present in the given array.

3. *Subtract to Find Missing Number:*
   - Subtract the sum of the elements in the array from the expected sum (calculated using the formula). The result will be the missing number.

4. *Edge Cases:*
   - Consider edge cases where the missing number might be the smallest (1) or the largest number in the range.

# Day 14: Task

*Question:27 *Find the Maximum Sum from Two Arrays**
*Problem Statement:*  
Create a function findMaxSum that accepts two arrays of numbers. The function should determine the maximum number from each array and return the sum of these two maximum numbers.

*Example:*  
typescript
findMaxSum([3, 5, 7, 2, 8], [10, 20, 30, 5]); // Output: 38 (8 from the first array + 30 from the second array)
findMaxSum([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]); // Output: 9 (3 from the first array + 6 from the second array)


*Hints:*  
1. *Step 1: Write a Helper Function to Find the Maximum Value in an Array*
   - Start by creating a function findMax that takes an array of numbers as its parameter.
   - Initialize a variable (e.g., let max = array[0];) to store the first element of the array, assuming it to be the maximum.
   - Use a for loop to iterate over the remaining elements of the array.
   - During each iteration, compare the current element with max. If the current element is greater, update max.
   - After the loop, max will hold the largest number in the array. Return this value.

2. *Step 2: Apply the Helper Function to Both Arrays*
   - Use the findMax function to find the maximum value in both input arrays.
   - Store these maximum values in two separate variables.

3. *Step 3: Sum the Maximum Values*
   - Calculate the sum of the two maximum values obtained from the arrays.
   - Return the final sum.

4. *Step 4: Test with Multiple Scenarios*
   - Test the function with different arrays to ensure it correctly finds the maximum values and sums them.
  
     
---
*Question 28: *Check if a String is a Palindrome**
*Problem Statement:*  
Write a function isPalindrome that takes a string as input and checks if it reads the same backward as forward. The function should return true if the string is a palindrome and false otherwise.

*Example:*  
typescript
isPalindrome("madam"); // Output: true
isPalindrome("hello"); // Output: false


*Hints:*  
1. *Step 1: Normalize the String*
   - Convert the string to lowercase to handle case sensitivity (str = str.toLowerCase();).
   - If necessary, remove non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) to focus on the actual content.

2. *Step 2: Use Two-Pointer Technique*
   - Initialize two pointers: one at the start of the string (let left = 0;) and one at the end (let right = str.length - 1;).
   - Use a while loop to compare characters at these pointers. Continue looping until the two pointers meet in the middle.
   - If at any point the characters at left and right pointers do not match, return false.

3. *Step 3: Complete the Loop*
   - If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, the string is a palindrome. Return true.

4. *Step 4: Test with Various Strings*
   - Test the function with both palindromes and non-palindromes to verify that it works as expected.

# Day 15: Task

*Question 29: Anagrams*

*Problem:*
Write a TypeScript function areAnagrams(str1: string, str2: string): boolean that checks if two strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase using all the original letters exactly once.

*Hints:*

1. *Normalize Case:*
   - Convert both strings to lowercase to ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.
   - Traverse each character of the strings and convert uppercase characters to lowercase.

2. *Count Characters:*
   - Use a fixed-size data structure like an array to count the occurrences of each character in both strings. Since we're only dealing with lowercase letters, an array of size 26 (for 'a' to 'z') will suffice.
   - Initialize two arrays (or two objects with 26 keys) to keep track of character frequencies for each string.

3. *Compare Character Counts:*
   - After populating the frequency arrays for both strings, compare them to determine if they are identical.
   - If they match, then the two strings are anagrams; otherwise, they are not.

4. *Edge Cases:*
   - Check if the strings have different lengths initially. If they do, they cannot be anagrams.
   - Handle empty strings as valid anagrams of each other.

*Question 30: Reverse Words in a Sentence*

*Problem:*
Write a TypeScript function reverseWords(sentence: string): string that reverses the words in a given sentence. For example, if the input is "Hello world", the output should be "world Hello".

*Hints:*

1. *Identify Word Boundaries:*
   - Traverse the sentence character by character.
   - Detect the start and end of each word by identifying spaces or the start/end of the string.

2. *Extract Words:*
   - Use indices to keep track of where each word starts and ends.
   - Build an array of words from these indices by manually copying characters into new strings.

3. *Reverse the Order of Words:*
   - After extracting the words, create a new array to hold them in reverse order.
   - Iterate through the original array of words from the end to the beginning and insert them into the new array.

4. *Reconstruct the Sentence:*
   - Concatenate the reversed array of words into a single string, ensuring that words are separated by spaces.

5. *Edge Cases:*
   - Handle multiple spaces between words by treating consecutive spaces as single separators.
   - Consider sentences with leading, trailing, or multiple spaces.

*Question 37: Find the Maximum Difference*
*Problem Statement:*
Given an array of integers, find the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. The difference should be calculated as difference = arr[j] - arr[i] where j > i.

*Example:*
typescript
Input: [2, 7, 9, 5, 1, 3, 5]
Output: 7
Explanation: The maximum difference is between 9 and 2, where 9 - 2 = 7.


*Hint:*  
Iterate through the array, keeping track of the minimum value encountered so far. Calculate the difference between the current element and the minimum value and update the maximum difference accordingly.

*Question 38: String Character Frequency*
*Problem Statement:*
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns an object where the keys are characters and the values are the frequency of those characters in the string.

*Example:*
typescript
Input: "hello"
Output: { h: 1, e: 1, l: 2, o: 1 }


*Hint:*  
Use an object to store the frequency of each character. Iterate over the string and update the count for each character

# Day 20: Task

*Question 39: Check for Prime Number*
*Problem:*  
Write a TypeScript function that takes a positive integer as input and checks whether it is a prime number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. If the number is prime, return true; otherwise, return false.

*Hint:*  
- Use a loop to check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.
- If the number is divisible by any of these, it is not prime.

typescript
function isPrime(num: number): boolean {
    // Your code here
}

---
*Question 40: Reverse a Number*
*Problem:*  
Write a TypeScript function that takes a number as input and returns the number with its digits reversed. For example, if the input is 1234, the output should be 4321.

*Hint:*  
- Convert the number to a string, reverse the string, and then convert it back to a number.

typescript
function reverseNumber(num: number): number {
    // Your code here
}
