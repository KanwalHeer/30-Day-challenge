*Question 1: Array Comparison and Manipulation (Updated)*

Create a function in TypeScript that takes two arrays of numbers as input. The function should perform the following operations based on the conditions given:

1. *If the lengths of both arrays are the same and all elements are the same:*
   - Merge both arrays into one array.
   - Multiply all elements of the merged array to produce a single number.
   - Return the product.

2. *If the lengths of both arrays are different:*
   - Merge both arrays into one array.
   - Return the middle element of the merged array.

3. *If the lengths of both arrays are the same but elements are different:*
   - Make the elements of both arrays the same by adding corresponding elements.
   - Merge the arrays.
   - Return the sum of the elements of the resulting merged array.

*Hints:*
- Use loops to compare elements and calculate new values.
- Avoid using built-in array methods.
- Think about how to find the middle element of an array when lengths are different.

*Example:*
typescript
function manipulateArrays(arr1: number[], arr2: number[]): number {
    // Your implementation here
}

// Example Test Cases
// manipulateArrays([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]) should output 216 (product of [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3])
// manipulateArrays([1, 2], [3, 4, 5]) should output 3 (middle element of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
// manipulateArrays([1, 2], [3, 4]) should output 6 (sum of [1, 2, 1, 2])

*Question 2: Extract First Letters from String Array*

Create a function in TypeScript that takes an array of strings (names) as input. The function should return a new array containing the first letter of each name.

*Hints:*
- Iterate through each name in the array.
- Extract the first letter of each name without using built-in methods.

*Example:*
typescript
function extractFirstLetters(names: string[]): string[] {
    // Your implementation here
}

// Example Test Case
// extractFirstLetters(["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"]) should output ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"]
