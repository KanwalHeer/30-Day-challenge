Day 23

### Question 1: Calculate the Factorial of a Number
Task: Write a function calculateFactorial that takes a number as input and returns its factorial.

Hint: Factorial means multiplying a number by all positive integers less than it. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

### Question 2: Convert a Number to Binary (Without Using Built-in Functions)
Task: Write a function convertToBinary that takes a number as input and converts it into its binary form.

Hint: Repeatedly divide the number by 2 and note down the remainder. Join the remainders in reverse order to get the binary representation.
