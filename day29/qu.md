*Question 1: Calculate the Product of Non-Zero Digits*

Description:

Write a TypeScript function that takes a number as input and returns the product of all non-zero digits in the number.

Example:
typescript
Input: 4056
Output: 120  // 4 * 5 * 6 = 120

Input: 1002
Output: 2  // 1 * 2 = 2


Hint: Loop through each digit, skip zeros, and multiply the rest.

*Question 2: Find the Difference Between the Largest and Smallest Digit*

Description:

Write a TypeScript function that takes a number as input and returns the difference between its largest and smallest digits.

Example:
typescript
Input: 7593
Output: 6  // 9 - 3 = 6

Input: 12345
Output: 4  // 5 - 1 = 4


Hint: Convert the number to a string or use a loop to identify the largest and smallest digits, then calculate their difference.
